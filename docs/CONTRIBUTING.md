## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a general set of guidelines for contributing to Green Monster Jelly. It will consist of a guide to the development process, some best practices for improving the speed of getting your code shipped, and what constitutes a good issue or pull request. These are not rigid rules, and are meant to guide new contributors through making there first pull request.

## Development Process
So, you set up your environment, played around with the app, and you discover a bug you'd like to fix, where should you start? Well, when you have decided you want to contribute, the very first step should be to make an issue on our [github page](https://github.com/michiganhackers/spotify-open-source-proj/issues). Here, you will include information about what you would like to add/change to the project as well as why you believe it will benefit the project. Check out [making a good issue/pull request](#how-to-make-a-good-issuepull-request) for more information on crafting a quality issue. From here, you will be contacted by a project maintainer who may either approve your request or follow up with questions and/or concerns. At some point, you will likely gain approval to submit a pull request to this issue, and will be assigned to the issue.

Alternatively, if you decide to attack an already posted issue, you should again request approval to be assigned to the issue.

After meticulously debugging the project and finally arriving at a suitable solution, you decide your code is suitable to be pushed to ~~main~~ dev. To do so, you should submit a pull request again on our [github](https://github.com/michiganhackers/spotify-open-source-proj/pulls). In here, you will document your changes to the code and how you've tested them. Expect to receive heavy feedback, including any requested changes. More info on making a good pull request [here](#how-to-make-a-good-issuepull-request). Eventually, your pull request may be approved and your code committed to our codebase. Congratulations!


## Best Practices
- Always work out of the dev branch.
- Communicate your ideas early and often, there is no point in implementing and debugging code that doesn't comply with the goals of the project.
- When attempting to resolve an issue on our github, make sure nobody has been assigned to it yet.
- Before submitting a pull request, make sure you have removed all unnecessary comments, debugging logging statements, and any other changes that are not vital to the functionality.
- Always provide a comprehensive list of how you tested your pull request, it will help to speed up maintainers' response times.
